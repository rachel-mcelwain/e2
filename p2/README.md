## Notes for instructor
The only issue I had was getting rid of the results on the orignial load. If I set my results to null then the original variables would be undefined on loading instead, which I tried to fix that issue but was unsuccessful, so I left the form alone and showed the results on the load. Hope this doesn't impact my grade!
